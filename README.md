An End-to-End Fantasy Premier League Analytics and Insights Application

Hi! My name is Alex and welcome to my repo for a passion project I'm working on. It's an end-to-end analytics project having to do with the wonderful game of Fantasy Premier League. 

I'm at the current stage of plumbing the data. But as time goes on I hope to deliver an analytics layer for FPL players to leverage during their season. In addition, I would love explore the data myself and employ some machine learning methodologies :) 

Thanks for stopping by!

## TODO:
- Add 'filename' to fpl_config.json, Re: Try to allow for more dynamic use of `write_to_file()`, right now this is hard-coded across the different modules.
- Pull src for snapshots from Raspberry Pi to this repo Re: those are currently "testing" and do not match the src in this repo
- Get a better understanding of what the transfer data is actually measuring, I.E. is this a rolling snapshot, cumulative
	- The overall transfer values just appear to increase over time...
